[DevOpsDays Seattle 2017](https://devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle) was held at McCaw Hall on April 26th and 27th. Around 400 participants saw a mix of internationally known and local speaker talking about their challenges and successes.

After the end of the event, we sent around a survey. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. You can see the full results [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-SCTVN9PB/).

Some things that went very well:

* The speakers all did a great job. You can watch a recording of each session by clicking on the title on our [program page](/events/2017-seattle/program/).

**How likely are you to recommend that we repeat this event next year?**

Of course we'd love it if everyone was extremely likely, but really excited by those results

**When considering time allocation next year, we should consider...**

This probably proves the theory that says no specific format is everyone's favorite, but
it's good to see that more than half like it "the way it is". Still, we'll talk about the
other answers when planning next year.

**When considering funding allocation next year we should consider...**

**What would help make the event even better?**

"Dedicated Seattle #Hashtag rather than just #devopsdays There were at least 50 people waitlisted, would like to see more of my team come since we are local" -

"Signs to open space locations" - "A bit more organizational structure around facilitating the Open Space Talks." - "A way to vote for open space topics that took into consideration the two votes. On Day 2 there were 3 topics in round 1 I wanted to attend and none in round 2/3 so I left early" -

We had quite a few comments about the available spots for open spaces. The venue is beautiful,
but only had 2 rooms to dedicate to open spaces. That meant most of the discussions where in
lobby areas where it wasn't always easy to hear the discussion.

A few people noted (quite correctly) that we could have done a better job with signage
and directions for the open space sessions.

A couple sponsors noted they'd like to have a way to scan badges. We've had concern that
this type of thing makes it feel more like a trade show than a volunteer driven community event,
but the comments have not gone unnoticed.

**What did you enjoy the most?**
