Last October, 23-27 2017 we celebrated at Melia Marina Varadero the second 
annual event of DevOpsDays Cuba with participation of more than 120 delegates. 
The event was well received and of great interest to different educational institutions such as: Informatics 
Science University (UCI), Central University (UCLV) and others Universities 
from different regions of the country. In addition, the public sector was 
represented by professionals of companies related to Software Industry 
and Telecommunications services such as: DESOFT, DATYS, GEOCUBA, ETECSA, XETID, etc. 
As a great improvement, this year the event was well received by IT professionals 
of the young private sector in Cuba (TCP).

  All attendees were able to share and experience speakers from Cuba, United States, United Kingdom, France, and Belgium in addition to the conversations that the attendees had with the speakers during Open Spaces. The first day, we covered subjects related with <b>“Cultural and DevOps adoptions”</b>, the event began with extended and engaged discussions of a speaker panel model with the International Speakers. The sessions continued with an [All Day DevOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/) Watch Party viewing live on-line transmissions of talks selected by attendees votes followed by discussions during Open Spaces.

The other work days started with Keynotes and Main Talks of Speakers, 
followed by Ignite  Talks, Open Spaces sessions to interchange knowledge 
and experiences. The first presentation of the event was by US expert [Randy 
Shoup](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-cuba/speakers/randy-shoup/), 
with his experience related with DevOps adoption in organizations like 
Google, Ebay and  Stitch Fix; and Puerto Rican expert 
[Mike Rosado](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-cuba/program/mike-rosado/) 
closed the last work session with a workshop to summarize essential elements of DevOps to 
delivery business value to the organization, that received a lot of interest 
in official web page.

In general terms, the main topics discussed at the events were: Practices 
and Configuration Management Tools, Docker, Monitoring of resource and 
services, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, DevOps as cultural 
movement in Enterprises, Hiring DevOps professionals, Infrastructure as Code, 
Microservices and legacy app migration, Testing of infrastructure projects, 
experiences building reactive applications, Big Data solutions with DevOps approach, 
and other interesting topics presented in open spaces discussions that 
propitiated Win-Win experience to all attendees.

Sections occupied all day (9:00 AM - 6:00 PM). It was gratifying to note 
that until late at night several professionals exchanged experiences on 
some topics of interest and that for reasons of time available were not 
presented in the program, such is the case of the talks on "Data services 
in microservices" by Randy Shoup or on the "Integrating role of a Cloud 
Architect in companies" by Lee Fox, or on the creation of IT communities, 
offered by Aymen El Amri.

The final activity planned as Beach Party was suspended by the hotel because 
of the bad weather conditions, but that did not stop us and we continued 
with enthusiasm to finish doing an after party at the Hotel Pool, celebrating 
the event success with salsa music, karaoke, and dance class. The right person 
to animate the sessions was Lee Fox with his positive energy and contagious 
enthusiasm [#selfieswithleeshat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/selfieswithleeshat?src=hash).
