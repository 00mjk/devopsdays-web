Building teams that are functional and collaborative, especially while being in a remote office, can be hard. Helping a company understand why they need to grow a remote team is key to the process.

In this talk, we'll cover the journey of the team, as it goes from being out of hours support to being a functional and collaborative team. We'll investigate the needs for the team, how we decided to go about growing the team, and onboarding & mentoring new members.
