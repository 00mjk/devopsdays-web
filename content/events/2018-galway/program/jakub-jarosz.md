Many DevOps engineers are familiar with tools like Serverspec and InSpec. They help to validate if provisioned machines meet pre-defined requirements. Goss is a relatively new tool in this space. It can be described as a “yaml based alternative to serverspec” written in Go. Infrastructure tests are expressed in yaml files. They can be also auto-generated from the current system state and served as a health endpoint. During the talk we will demonstrate how to install Goss, write and generate basic infrastructure tests and integrate Goss with Ansible.
