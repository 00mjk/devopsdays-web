Continuous integration and delivery has come a long way in the past few years. What we now take for granted because of the prevalence of CI/CD in modern tech companies would have been considered impossible only a decade ago. 

This talk will start with a general introduction to CI/CD pipelines, what is the basis of these pipelines, why were they started in the first place, what are we trying to achieve from them and how these pipelines have evolved over the years.

It is a constant struggle in organizations to setup a robust, reliable, functional and fast deployment pipeline that takes your work to deployment in the most reliable fashion and in the minimum amount of time. 

The talk will reflect on some of the vital technical design principles that should be considered during the implementation of the continuous deployment pipelines. The purpose is to motivate the teams to take a moment and reflect on their Continuous deployment pipelines architecture with the sole purpose of evaluating and determining the steps that can be taken to improve it. The presentation will discuss in detail multiple common obstructions and hurdles that can exist in a continuous deployment pipeline. For example security, tooling, visualization, complexity etc 

There are challenges ahead and the industry is going through a phase shift in terms of faster release cycles and better product quality, but on the bright side, things are moving fast and in  most  cases  in  the  right  direction. I have no doubt in my mind that mature and reliable CD processes will be a standard in the future in any organization.
