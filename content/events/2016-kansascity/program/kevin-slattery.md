The Everything Is OK Alarm
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Increased monitoring capabilities come at a cost - nobody reads the email notifications. With help from a Raspberry Pi, The Everything Is OK Alarm will continue to sound as long as everything is working correctly.
Can also be used to alarm when everything is *not* OK, but then it'd always be going.
