"I love technology and people. What a joy it is to connect them both!"

I have a PhD in Computer Science and I am a professional Software Engineer with focus in Artificial Intelligence. My professional experience involves the design and development of commercial and industrial software systems for companies like TOTVS S.A., TecBan S.A. and Alstom S.A., as well as the design and development of board and digital games for my own company and a game studio in SÃ£o Paulo. I also have taught in both graduation and under-graduation courses of Computer Science and Game Development at different private universities in Brazil.

Currently I am a Senior Software Engineer at Uber Technologies, working on the Safety & Insurance Data team at the Sao Paulo Tech Center. Yes, we are hiring people who are crazy about the idea of being part of a Global team who ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion! Check it out for more information:
