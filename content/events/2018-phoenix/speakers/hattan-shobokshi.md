Hi, I'm Hattan Shobokshi. I'm a software architect with many years of experience building full stack web applications. I'm heavily invested into DevOps and have lead Site Reliability Engineering teams as well as Release Teams. I've helped architect several deployment pipelines for large scale web and database solutions. I'm also a big fan of the developer community and contribute by running the LA .NET meetup as well as SoCal Code Camp, a software development conference.
