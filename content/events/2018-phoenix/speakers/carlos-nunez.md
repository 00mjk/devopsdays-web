Hi! I'm Carlos. I'm a DevOps Engineer at Roundtower. My mission is to help businesses reach new and existing customers quickly and more safely by using automation, "everything-as-code" and implementing better engineering culture to make "the business" and "IT" one in the same. In a past life, I was a Windows systems engineer that built onboarding systems for employees, secure execution environments for Windows (think: AWS Run) and various tools for automation.

On my off time, I enjoy road biking, working out, writing, visiting new breweries and doing badly at trivia.
