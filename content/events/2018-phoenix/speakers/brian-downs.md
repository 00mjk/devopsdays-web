Principal Software Engineer at Brightcove working on the next generation platform for dynamic video delivery. I have a passion for all things Go, AWS, and programming in general. I spend free time contributing to large and well known open source projects, as well as my own small projects for fun, and spend a large portion of time mentoring others. In that same vein, I run the Phoenix Go meetup helping to build a larger Go community and help those get Go programs developed in more companies here in the valley.
