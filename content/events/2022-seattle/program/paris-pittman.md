In this session, Paris will welcome you to help write the next chapter of Kubernetes.
In 2019, the Kubernetes project entered its current chapter when the original group of community leaders passed the baton of governance to the first fully community-elected steering committee.
How has the community adapted to the rise and ubiquity of Kubernetes adoption? What kind of challenges does the project face in trying to create sustainable momentum? What does the project need from contributors and companies that want to support it? Paris will walk you through a mix of history, some introspection, and make a call to action to the broader DevOps cloud-native community. Attendees will be brought into the governance side of the heptagon to tell the story of what itâ€™s really like to steward one of the worlds largest and fastest growing multi-stakeholder open source projects.
