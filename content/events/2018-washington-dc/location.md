Auditorium](http://www.uspto.gov/) at 600 Dulany Street, Alexandria, Virginia,

for driving directions and parking information.

## Transportation


DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst in the
nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you are visiting
from out of town. Instead, take [Metro](http://www.wmata.com/) to the event.  
USPTO is located a few blocks from the [King Street/Old
Town](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/king-street.cfm) station, which
is served by Blue and Yellow line trains. It is also a short ride from [National
Airport (DCA)](http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport), our
recommended airport for visitors from out of town. If you are arriving at Dulles
(IAD), Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station, Metro's [trip
planner](http://wmata.com/rider_tools/tripplanner/tripplanner_form_solo.cfm) can
help you get to the event.
