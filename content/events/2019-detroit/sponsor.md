<h3>About</h3>
<p>
DevOps Days is dedicated to bringing systems administration and development together. Michigan, and Detroit specifically,
is uniquely positioned to lead this integration due to its highly skilled engineers. We are a collection of makers with a
common vision for excellence, change, and the grit to reinvent a city. Presentations will have a broad range of topics, with
something for everyone. This conference is about much more than the tools we use. It is a forum for exploring the cultural
impact that DevOps has on an organization. Hearing this positive, powerful message from our peers is the best way to
integrate this way of thinking. Come join us for a unique yearly event that will showcase a slice of that collective innovation.
People in all stages of their career will be present from university students, to local startups, to leaders of industry.
