Due to COVID-19 and the health risks of an in-person conference DevOpsDays Chicago 2020 will now be a one-day virtual event taking place on Sept 1, 2020. We are currently working on refactoring the sponsorship offerings. Our priority is to offer a unique and valuable virtual conference that includes our distinctive community engagement.

Due to the different needs in a virtual version of DevOpsDays Chicago we do plan to alter sponsorship amounts and offerings. If you are interested in sponsoring, please <a href="mailto:chicago-sponsors@devopsdays.org?subject=Interested%20in%20Sponsoring%20DevOpsDays%20Chicago%202020">send us an email</a>.
