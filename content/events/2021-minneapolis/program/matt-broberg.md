From massive corporations to small startups and back again, my resume has some pendulum swings. I’ve grown in title and salary along the way, but never had a formal promotion until recently. What's changed? I’m telling myself a different story than I used to; I’m also finding healthy ways to influence my company to invest in my teammates, in salary and title. Effective, healthy, and optimistic: I'll share the stories I’ve told myself as I go from role to role. Hopefully this approach is helpful as you write your stories!
