In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, devopsdays Minneapolis is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2021 event:

  * We plan to have a hybrid event with in-person and online components. If indicated by the [Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Risk Measures](https://mn.gov/covid19/data/response-prep/public-health-risk-measures.jsp), we will re-assess closer to the time of the event and make any necessary adjustments.

  * Masks (covering nose and mouth) and social distancing will be expected for in-person participants at the devopsdays MSP 2021 event. We are following the [Minnesota Department of Health Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/facecover.html) and the [City of Minneapolis: COVID-19 Health & Safety Information](https://www.minneapolis.org/covid-19-health-safety/)

  * We are asking all in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) to have received a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two (2) weeks prior to this event, by July 5, 2021.

  * If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by July 6, 2021 and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
