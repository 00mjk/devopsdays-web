Figuring out how to get k8s up & running is a PIA. Then there’s managing it in production. Before that, though, you need to figure out why you’d even want to run it, which k8s to use, where to run it, & still more. Using IRL cases, this talk covers the the options so you pick the k8s right for you.

What exactly should you do with kubernetes? When it comes to running kubernetes, there’s a matrix of options: running your own instance or using a distribution, how you fill in the missing parts and customizing it, choosing to run in private cloud or public cloud, bringing your own kubernetes to a public cloud or using the instances sold by the providers, what PaaS you’ll run on-top of the cluster to actually run your software, using kubernetes for legacy or just green field applications, who in your organization will manager your cluster and who won’t…or maybe you’re supposed to just “leapfrog” all of this and go “serverless,” whatever that means.

The options are delightfully numerous! Of course, going through this exercise assumes you even have the problems kubernetes is trying to solve, but how would figure that out?

This talk will address these questions, and, using case studies of success - and failure! - provide you with a toolkit for putting together your kubernetes strategy...if you actually need one.
