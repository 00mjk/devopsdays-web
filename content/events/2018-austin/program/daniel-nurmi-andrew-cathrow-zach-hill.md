Containers are rapidly being adopted by many organizations. Developers gain huge advantages from fast prototyping, quick development cycles, and a purpose-built environment for their applications. But when these new apps go into production, DevOps and Security Engineers find themselves with something much more difficult to manage. In this talk we will discuss some of the pitfalls that we have seen when moving container-based apps through the continuous integration pipeline from development to production, and review how open source tools like the Anchore Engine can ensure security and compliance in your containerized environment.

Who is the audience: Anyone using containers in a production environment: developers as well as those responsible for operations and security. If you have containers in your CI/CD pipeline, you will find this talk useful. If youâ€™re planning on deploying containers into production in the near future, this talk will help you avoid some pitfalls.
