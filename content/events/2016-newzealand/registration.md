###Diversity Tickets
We recognise that one barrier to attending conferences is that people may not have the privilege of working at a job that affords them conference attendance. We will review all submissions, if selected you will be notified via email. We are awarding a limited amount of scholarship tickets to attend DevOpsDays Wellington 2016 conference which includes all the keynote sessions, ignite talk sessions, open spaces, meals and social networking activities. We are not in a position to cover travel or accomodation.

Please send your application stating your name and a brief reason on the impact attending DevOpsDays Wellington will have. Send you email to admin@devopsdays.nz.
