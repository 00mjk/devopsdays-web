Is DevOps dead?  Have we seen the end of the original intent of the movement that set a path to re-energize the engineering community?  With the emergence of a pointed focus on tools and now massive organizations selling 2-day DevOps certifications, have we lost our way?  This talk re-centers the focus of the engineering community to why we started this journey originally; to focus on learning, culture and feedback loops within complex systems and organizations.  We will use data and stories from the trenches to weave a message about the anti-patterns that are emerging, but shine a focus on the stories of success and what good outcomes look like.
