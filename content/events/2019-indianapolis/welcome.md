<h3><b>Kubernetes Training by IBM</b></h3>

Microservices revolutionized the way we look at app development and is
now one of the most popular programming architectures. Now, Docker
alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of
these microservices. Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade
orchestration for your “Dockerized” microservices.

In this workshop, you’ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and what it
provides for application development. You’ll then go through the process
of building and deploying a microservice application on Kubernetes.

This is a hands-on-keyboard lab, everyone should come with a laptop and
a desire to learn. Attendees can use minikube locally, or cloud accounts
will be provided. We’ll cover:

<ul>
<li>Kubernetes basics</li>
<li>Building Container Images</li>
<li>Deploying the application with Kubernetes</li>
<li>Upgrading and scaling the application with Kubernetes</li>
<li>Debugging your application in Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

Please bring your laptop running a copy of Chrome or Firefox. We will be
doing everything online and via a cloud shell.

<h3><b>Cloud Native Continuous Delivery with GoCD by ThoughtWorks</b></h3>

<p>
When GoCD was created about a decade ago it was the first server built
specifically for continuous delivery. A lot has changed in that decade,
both in the software we’re deploying and the types of pipelines needed
to work with it.

In this Workshop, participants will use Helm to provision a new GoCD
system on kubernetes, configure it to automatically stop and start build
agents, and set it up to use pipeline configurations as code.

Once the server is provisioned, attendees will create pipelines which
test and deploy software to a kubernetes cluster.

Requirements and prerequisites for this session will be updated
approximately one month before the event. Bring your laptop.
