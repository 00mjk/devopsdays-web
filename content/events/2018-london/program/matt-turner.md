The network is back. But is it useful? While the momentum of containerization and kubernetes is well established, service meshes are a much-hyped, but still emerging field. What actually are they, and are they worth looking at?

We'll explore what a service mesh is and what they claim to do for a typical microservices web backend. Are the claims of free and easy observability, resiliency, testing and security real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? How well do they work at the moment, and is the hassle really worth it?

This session will also briefly cover how a service mesh works, giving you a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk. I'll show a simple installation and demo, giving you all the knowledge to go home and try for yourself.
