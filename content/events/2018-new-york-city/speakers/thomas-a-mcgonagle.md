Tom is a Senior Product Management Engineer at F5 Networks.

Tom recently celebrated his 10th DevOps birthday having jumped into practicing
DevOps systems management in 2007. He had a “gestalt” when he first heard of
Puppet. He recognized it as essentially an open cloud “operating system”.
Puppet’s characteristics as an open platform were similar to Linux’s when he
first discovered it in 1997. Since then he has worked at OpenShift as a Site
Reliability Engineer, Booz Allen Hamilton as a DevOps strategist, and CloudBees
as a Senior DevOps Consultant.

Before getting into DevOps, Tom specialized in WiFi and microwave
telecommunications in Africa. He has consulted on several HIV anti-retroviral
drug distribution supply chain management projects and co-authored a very well
received paper on Open Source Wireless in Tanzania and Boston
(http://goo.gl/3OoE1) and is looking forward to writing a follow up based on
his consulting work.
