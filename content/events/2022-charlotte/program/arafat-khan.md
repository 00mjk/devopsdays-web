I want to share my experiences with the people who are coming from a non-devops background and are curious if this role would be the right fit for them.

Whatâ€™s the kind of intellectual self examination that needs to be done before making a switch to devops? And once they decide to make a switch, how can they best optimize their learning to make the most out of a devops role?
