Database Administrators have always had one foot in development and the other in production, yet in many organizations, the database represents a walled garden. While the industry has been undergoing a revolution in how we build and deploy apps, the database is often left out of this discussion. But databases aren’t going away and the challenges around managing them aren’t going away either, so we need to talk about how to build and run database services in our new modern world.

This talk will walk you through various examples and issues and show you that it is not about the tools but about techniques you can use to break down barriers between different roles and establish common ownership of technology within your organizations. Monitoring and visibility, managing schema changes, production deployments, optimization, configuration, and backups; there are aspects to data storage that bring about unique challenges. You won’t need to adopt all of these techniques to be successful, but it’s time we had a frank conversation about what it takes to make your database truly “webscale”.
