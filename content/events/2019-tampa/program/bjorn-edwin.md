As a former employee of Capital One, I was an in-house expert and integral champion of their transformation journey from Agile, ATDD to DevOps and Cloud. This role gave me a different kind of leverage and ownership when compared with my efforts leading a similar transformation on a bigger scale at another top bank as a Consultant at Liatrio. Liatrio is the consulting firm you won’t hate. We’re boots-on-the-ground change agents, uplifting organizational culture, tools, and processes.

The goal of this talk is to share my experiences (and advice) on how to lead a DevOps transformation, focusing mainly on the differences between leading a transformation as an in-house expert vs. as a consultant. In this talk, I’ll discuss the following:

Real-world examples of small things that can be really difficult to change, along with bigger challenges that are easier to address as a consultant than as an employee.
How struggles are overcome in different ways and successes are perceived very differently depending on your role (in house or consultant=
Tips and tricks that can help you lead a transformation for any organization (regardless whether you’re an in-house expert or an outside consultant). Examples include tools, process, skills and people.
