This presentation gives concrete examples of implementing open source security tools in a continuous integration pipeline. For example: jenkins, gauntlt, selenium, and arachni can be used to log into a web application, passively scan it for vulnerabilities, and then fail a build based on specific vulnerabilities that are identified. The conversation will also cover tips for rolling out these tools successfully.
