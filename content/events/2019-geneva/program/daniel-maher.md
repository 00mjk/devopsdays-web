There are thousands of professional speaking opportunities around the world every month, but why bother engaging? For the employee: professional development, personal satisfaction, and a deeper connection with the the topic and related community are among the rewards. For the employer: opportunities for networking, brand awareness, and recruiting are but a few of the benefits. In this presentation, we’ll explore the myriad reasons for speaking at a conference or a meet-up—from both the employee and employer standpoint—and dive into how to build an internal programme to develop and promote public speakers within your organisation.
Note to conference organisers: I’d be happy to pair this with a workshop or open space covering one or more of the following topics: identifying material and opportunities, how to CFP successfully, preparing slides, and public speaking tips & tricks.
