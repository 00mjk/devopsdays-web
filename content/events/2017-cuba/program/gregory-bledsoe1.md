In this talk we’ll present a formal, data-based DevOps maturity model as well 
as walk through examples of high functioning DevOps organizations.

We’ll talk about the underlying concepts of “maturity,” how to measure such 
an ephemeral concept, and start laying the groundwork for understanding not 
only what our goal is, but why that is our goal.

There are two ways to think about DevOps Maturity. The first can be pictured 
as a line graph with an X axis expressing the width of collaboration and and 
a Y axis of the depth of automation, The second is to picture a mature organization 
as one that has produced a collaborative, empowered culture with a governance 
structure that has allowed repeatable, highly automated practices and processes 
to emerge. There are ways to measure state against this ideal and track progress 
towards it that we’ll explore.
