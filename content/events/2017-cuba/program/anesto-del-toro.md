In this talk weâ€™ll share some experiences during the development of the CIR-BCC 
(Risk Information Center - Cuban Central Bank). We briefly describe the problem, 
the main challenges and their impact in architectural and design keys decisions. 
We present some insights of our reactive modular solution, developed with Scala, 
Play Framework and Akka, and we illustrate how Event Sourcing (ES), Command-Query 
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Change Data Capture (CDC) have helped us to 
solve some important challenges. We expose several of the practices that have allowed 
us to achieve faster development and deployment cycles for this product.
