Achieving DevOps Maturity and a steady state of continuous learning and continuous 
improvement require us to let go of our legacy thinking about how we manage IT 
and how we incentive our organizations. The rate-limiter of this process is not 
technical, but human. The pace at which people can take in the new goals, change 
their beliefs about their role in the organization, create new ways of working 
and the new culture of collaboration is generally much slower than the technical 
work to implement tools and automation. Without changing our minds about the way 
to do the job, without transforming our governance and processes to adapt to these 
new ways of working, we do not transform and find ourselves stuck in our traditional 
modes of operation, unable to effectively integrate our systems into a cohesive hole 
that enables agility and high velocity.

This talk will focus on the elements of a formal transformation methodology that 
tackles all the elements that must be included for a top to bottom transformation 
as well as the steps and timelines that it takes to propel us along that path, and 
the way to tailor this to any organization will be proposed.
