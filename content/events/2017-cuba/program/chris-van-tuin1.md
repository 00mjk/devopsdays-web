vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking.

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn about:

* How Containers enable DevOps and the security risks with deploying containers in the enterprise
* Automating security vulnerability and compliance management in your CI/CD pipeline
* Scanning online and offline containers for security compliance vulnerabilities and generating 
security audit reports with OpenScap
