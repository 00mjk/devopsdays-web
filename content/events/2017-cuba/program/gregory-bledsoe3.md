DevOps is strongly correlated with financial results. Why? DevOps and Lean 
thinking inevitably lead to cultural revolution that favors empowerment. 
Looking to culture models that describe why can be used to extrapolate where 
DevOps is taking us and predict the future, and not just the future of IT.

This session is likely to change not just the way you see IT, but the world.

of many millennia old trends we can predict not only where IT is going, but 
foresee how these changes are spreading through the rest of business and the world.
