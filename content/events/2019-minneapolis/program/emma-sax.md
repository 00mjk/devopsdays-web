There’s an old and famous phrase: “Those who can’t do, teach.” It’s designed to be funny, but it insinuates that those who teach “don’t”. Probably closer to the truth: those that love to spend time with people (especially children) and want to help others may find passion in teaching, but that doesn’t mean that our teachers can’t “do.” In fact when people take the time to teach others (and review others’ work), they often learn even more than what they would’ve learned otherwise.
