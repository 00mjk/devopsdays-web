This talk will focus on how to achieve zero downtime deploys using Kubernetes. I will start with talking about what Docker and Kubernetes are, and how they make code deployment easier. Then, talk about basic concepts of Kubernetes (Pods, Services and Deployment), and why it is important. Next, demonstrate a way to deploy a simple application with Kubernetes and also give a run through on how to perform a rolling update without any downtime. I plan to also talk about how our traditional deploy processes worked, and how moving to Kubernetes has helped us deploy applications faster. I can even do a demo real quick if there is enough time.
