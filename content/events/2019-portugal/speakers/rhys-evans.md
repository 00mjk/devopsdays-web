#### Speaker

Iâ€™m Rhys, a former front-end developer who has crossed the road to become a reliability engineer. I work at the Financial Times, building tools to help our other teams operate reliable services. Out of work I spend my time birdwatching, playing musical instruments badly and wondering if the new Alan Partridge series is ever going to arrive on our screens.
