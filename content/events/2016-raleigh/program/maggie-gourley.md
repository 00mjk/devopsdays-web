Title: My Gaming Days Weren’t Wasted: How Gaming Trained Me for Testing in DevOps
Description:
Recognize me from my EA game credits? After many years as a gamer and in game testing, I began working as a QA engineer for a Boulder tech startup focused on DevOps. 

In this talk I’ll explain how I applied my game testing experience to test and improve enterprise software applications. Participants will take away helpful tips from game testing that they can use in their own environment. In the talk, I’ll share:

* Why it helps to have a background in testing games when testing a DevOps application
* How gamers and enterprise software customers have similar traits and needs
* Where testing differs between the groups
