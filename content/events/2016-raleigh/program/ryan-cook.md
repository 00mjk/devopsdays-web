Title: Oh no! MGMT wants to do DevOps now
Description:
During this Ignite talk we will demystify some common misconceptions about DevOps.  We will help answer such questions as "What about change control?", "What stops a developer from releasing unacceptable code?", and hush the phrases "but that's that's my job" or "that's not my job".
