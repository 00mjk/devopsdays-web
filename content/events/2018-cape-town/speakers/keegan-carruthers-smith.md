I'm a software engineer at Sourcegraph.com, a startup creating code search and code exploration tools. My passions lie in Developer Tooling/Infrastructure and writing simple performant software. Previously I worked on developer tooling at Facebook. Also spent a few years doing Maths and Computer Science at UCT.
