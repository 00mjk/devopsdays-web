##### TALK ABSTRACT

Since that first devopsdays in 2009 , I talked and walked devops for many years now. From that fringe idea to a world accepted term, it has been a pleasure and privilege to watch it grow. Along the way my view on it has evolved and that journey is what Iâ€™d like to share with you all.
