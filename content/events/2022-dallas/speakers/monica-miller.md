I am a new developer advocate/former data engineer who is excited to try her hand at speaking engagements. Iâ€™m a Dallas local residing in Richardson! I helped with new hire education for years at my old job, and led a class walking students through datastage labs for 6 hours a day 3 times a year. I now make youtube videos for Starburst if you want an example of non-live public speaking. I only learned about Trino 6 months ago, and I think it is important to share the good news of query federation to everyone so that they can have their technical lives improved with the concept.
