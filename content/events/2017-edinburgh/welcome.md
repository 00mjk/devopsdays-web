Where better than Edinburgh, capital city of Scotland, to hold a devopsdays conference? Scotland has offered so much innovation in terms of science, engineering, literature, the arts, medicine and more. The language of science and engineering is indebted to Scotland due to lumineries such as James Watt and Lord Kelvin. Modern times are full of Scottish inventions from the television we watch, to the phones we communicate with to the tarmac we drive on. Almost every day of our lives is affected by Scottish inventions and discoveries. Some of the worlds most beloved stories such as as Treasure Island, Peter Pan, Jekyll and Hyde, Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes have strong links to Scotland. Modern economics was founded by Adam Smith through his seminal work The Wealth of Nations. Medicine would be very different if it wasn't for the Scottish inventions of penicillin, hypodermic syringes, general anaesthetic and much, much more. And let's not forget the whisky! (But please forget the deep fried mars bar, it was a joke ok?)
