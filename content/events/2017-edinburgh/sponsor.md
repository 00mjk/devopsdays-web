We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  Gold, Silver and Bronze sponsorship packages are described below, an event prospectus will follow shortly.  Please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}] if you are interested in sponsoring.
<br>
<br>
Devopsdays is a self-organising not-for-profit conference that depends on sponsorship.  We do not sell product presentations, nor do we distribute attendee contact lists.  Gold and Silver sponsors receive table presence where they can engage with attendees during breaks.  They also receive the opportunity to provide ‘elevator pitch’ style presentations during the program of events and will receive recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.
<br>
<br>
Details of additional à la carte sponsorship opportunities may become available shortly.  Available in addition to, or in lieu of, the packages described in our prospectus.  Please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}] if you are interested.
<br>
<br>
All sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.  The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at Devopsdays so you can engage with attendees on their own terms.
<br>
<br>
Attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want for discussion in the Open Spaces portion of the conference, but keep in mind that Devopsdays is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on attendees.
