From time to time, we need a refresher on the LEAN techniques that guided manufacturing companies to their success. Why? Because they bring us back to the simple reality that we must remember and prioritize our organizational goal: To Make Money.

If we make money, management is happy, when management is happy employees are happy, when employees are happy they enjoy their work and build great products and thus the cycle continues.

I would like to take 5 minutes to explore some basic things to remember in that cycle and make an awesome journey to being successful in your work and making your organization successful.
