We greatly value sponsors for
this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at [{{<email_organizers>}}].
    <hr> devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths,
    sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator
    pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.
    Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any
    attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
    <p>
        Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit
        during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused
        conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
        <p>
            The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
            <p>
