<p>One of the founders of the Devops movement, he is a specialist in infrastructure automation and continuous delivery, with a particular emphasis on Chef.</p>

<p>SNS has a deep technical background in UNIX systems, Enterprise Hosting, and public and private cloud, and has architected and run web scale infrastructures across multiple technologies and architectures, encompassing traditional on-premise three-tier Java/Oracle stacks, through AWS-based Python/Scala/Clojure microservices, and Node/Erlang web/api platforms.</p>

<p>A serial entrepreneur, he was founding CTO of disruptive financial Cloud Broker, Strategic Blue, a Techstars accelerated company, and co-founder of ground-breaking Devops consultancy Atalanta Systems, meaning he understands the challenges and needs of organisations from the emergent to the established.</p>

<p>Stephen blends ideas from acceptance and commitment therapy, non-violent communication, mindfulness, clean language/learning and distributed cognition to shape an approach to digital and organisational health that goes beyond technology and agile frameworks.</p></p>
