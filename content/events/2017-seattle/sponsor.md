We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<hr>

<p>DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists.</p>
<p>Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.</p>
<p>
Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
</p>
<p>Most sponsors find they get the best response by sending engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.</p>
