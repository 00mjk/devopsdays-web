The technology landscape is getting progressively more complex, yet we are often afraid to admit our lack of expertise for fear of looking bad. This leads our teams and companies to make decisions without considering their full impact.

In my 14 years in the industry, I watched the technology landscape become more and more complex, with new tools and methodologies emerging and fading away every year. Yet I see "thought leaders" get up on stage every day, promising they can teach you the 3 easy steps to:

Achieve full software testability (a subset of the Halting Problem, which is undecidable)
Remediate 20 years of legacy code
Migrate your entire data center to the cloud
Adopt the new architectural pattern that is going to solve all of your problems
Beyond fostering imposter syndrome and burnout, this isn't good for business. In a room full of people embarrassed to admit that the emperor has no clothes, decisions are made without exploring their full implications.

In this talk, we will discuss why we should get better at admitting that hard problems are hard, and how this approach can help us build more resilient companies.

Key Takeaways:

Studies show that psychological safety is the most important predictor of team performance. We will discuss examples of how being empowered to voice dissenting opinions, deliver bad news, admit to making mistakes or lack of knowledge can have major positive effects on company performance.

We can take a page out of a science book and shift towards a “hypothesis-driven development”, which starts with admitting that we don’t know all the answers. Admitting ignorance was the key change in mindset that enabled modern science to move from rare, accidental technological discoveries to an exponential rate of progress.

As speakers, technical leads, and managers, we have a responsibility to foster psychological safety and encourage diversity of opinions in our industry as a whole.
