A word’s definition is black-and-white, but its connotation and etymology is not. Even the term “black-and-white” is based on the association of “black” with “evil” and “white” with “virtue”, dating back to the early 1800s. These words and phrases often implicitly (and sometimes even explicitly) alienate our coworkers and members of our community. As technologists, we have to ask ourselves: how do the words we choose impact those around us? This non-technical talk identifies words and phrases which can have alienating side-effects to our colleagues and peers, and it recommends replacements that have more inclusive connotation.
