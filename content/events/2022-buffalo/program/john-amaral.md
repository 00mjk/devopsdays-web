Shift left has become the favorite buzzword in basically every engineering discipline - from security, to quality and testing, product and more. The core tenets make sense - for better design, security and engineering patterns and keeping developers closer to the product. However, in practice this is easy to get wrong, leading to a significant amount of frustration, and, worst case, attrition, among developers.

In this talk I’d like to focus on some quickly achievable tips to building a great developer experience, before throwing more work in devs laps by shifting everything left. These include removing jobs that are repetitive and able to be automated, by adopting an automate-first mindset to remove bottlenecks and improve workflows, as well as looking for best of breed technology stacks and SaaS solutions for your objectives - no need to reinvent the wheel. With the abundance of great SaaS tooling - you may not need to DIY and can have some pretty great automation and orchestration out of the box. These combined can already provide some of the benefits of “shift left” without frustrating your devs. In this talk, I’ll provide practical tips for how to apply these in your engineering organization to improve velocity, as well as, dev well-being.
