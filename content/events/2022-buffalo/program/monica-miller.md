This is a talk for all audiences where I intend listeners will take away the importance of 1) finding sponsors instead of just mentors and 2) acting as a sponsor, specifically for underrepresented groups, by advocating for others

For the first couple of years of my career, I spent hours in pre-scheduled mentorship meetings with my female superiors who I was lucky enough to call mentors and friends. We talked about life, we talked about work, and we talked about why birthday cake ice cream was more appealing than regular birthday cake. Lots of talking. And I personally had lots of self-growth from the advice these women were able to give to me. However, it took me years to find a sponsor, and my career paid the price. Based on Jess Iandorio’s article, and the findings from A Lack of Sponsorship is Keeping Women From Advancing into Leadership, here’s the difference.

Mentors: People who give you feedback, typically with more experience than you. They encourage you to improve so you can create more opportunities for yourself.

Sponsors: People in positions of power who advocate for you. They create opportunities for you.

Statistically in technology, the majority of people who hold positions of leadership are men. So the majority of sponsors end up being men as well. I was never under the impression I could find even a male mentor, let alone a male sponsor. Once I did, I got a promotion. Not because of his gender, but because of his influence to help advocate for my abilities.

Find a sponsor by targeting those in the position of power and proving your skills. Help with a current project, pitch a new idea, or find something that can be improved and develop a plan around it. I had a couple of failed sponsorship attempts (and hours worked) before I found one that was willing to act, but in the end it all furthered my case once the information landed in the right hands.

Sponsors: Start looking for those individuals you initially wouldn’t look for. They are out there. Ask them a pertinent question in meetings that you know they have the answer to. Mention to your own superiors or peers if you see an individual making valuable contributions. Give credit where credit is due. It doesn't have to be a feeble attempt to find someone for the sake of it, because I guarantee once you open your eyes, you will be overwhelmed with the amount of talented individuals who belong to underrepresented groups.

I was inspired to submit this because of a new sponsor of mine, and I’m hoping that by discussing this topic today, the chain reaction continues.
