Goat (repos) have become a very useful tool for educating developers on well-known security plans and standards, such as the OWASP Top 10, through a hands-on code examples of applications that contain these vulnerabilities.

This talk, built upon a live coding demo, will demonstrate how your everyday applications can quickly become goats, riddled with vulnerabilities with one poor feature design and deployment. We will walk you through the tools and methods to discover common issues, often overlooked by developers, that are usually just sitting right there in your repository - one hack away from disaster.

We'll also share useful goat resources for the most common stacks, and how these projects can help bridge the dev / security divide.
