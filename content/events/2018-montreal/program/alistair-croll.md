Data Science and Critical Thinking: Data is behind every facet of business and society. But while we’re awash in data, we’re short on skepticism. Building on my work as a Visiting Executive at Harvard Business School, this talk shows how to think properly about data. It combines practical case studies, common pitfalls, and a clear framework for data lifecycles that everyone can understand, arming executive teams with the tools they need to survive and thrive in a data-driven era.
