A little bit about my background. I am a Production Engineer from Facebook. I joint company November last year fresh off college, relocated from Canada. Itâ€™s not hard to notice that we have even less female engineers at Infrastructure/Operations side of world. This is how I am inspired on talking about the challenges that I am facing as an entry level engineer and the support I wish to receive at this stage of my career.
