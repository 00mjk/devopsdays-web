GraphQL is a technology that is changing the way we deliver data to clients, replacing REST. However, it is not a fire-and-forget solution. This talk delves into some initial best practices that can be implemented from a security-first mindset to make GraphQL serve ALL the stakeholders best.

I have spent a great deal of the past 18 months building and hardening a series of production apps that leverage GraphQL for their data sources. Mobile apps, web platforms, and desktop applications are all benefiting from this interface, and while there are a number of software-focused solutions for using this tech, we must always be building with application and data security being at the forefront of our considerations. 

This talk focuses on a collection of steps that can be addressed at that boundary of development and DevOps that allow the deployment of this style of application to be done with confidence and security. This talk will discuss topics such as routing, query obfuscation, and GraphQL configuration.
