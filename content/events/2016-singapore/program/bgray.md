    <h2>DevOps: A cultural primer and practical lessons learnt</h2>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    DevOps is a complicated topic. Itâ€™s not enough and sometimes harmful to just form a DevOps team. There is no such thing as a DevOps Cure-all. But, if your development and operations teams start to collaborate you are on the right track! This talk will break DevOps down into its core ideas with an emphasis on learning from mistakes constructively and organizing teams effectively with supporting data from our annual State of DevOpsReport.

    Primarily a process and culture talk, the audience should come with an interest in DevOps and the talk is meant for both software and operations engineers as well as their management. A mix is best as aligning business goals is key to success    </p>

    <h2>When</h2>
    Saturday, 8th October
