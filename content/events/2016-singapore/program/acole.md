    <h2>An Introduction to Distributed Tracing and Zipkin</h2>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user perceptible delay. In today's world of microservices, this can be tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even data-centers.
    This session will overview how to debug latency and better understand your production environment with Zipkin. You'll see a demo and leave knowing how to get started with distributed tracing.    </p>
