    <h2>I want DevOps, but how do I justify it?</h2>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This talk will focus on the journey to adopting DevOps within your organisation. Many conversations we have with our customers start with “How will this deliver business value?”. We will aim to answer this question and show you steps of which you can take to truly understand what the DevOps culture is really about. We will also provide some quick wins that any organisation can begin to adopt without the big “DevOps transformation project”. To begin to quantify and justify the feasibility of a DevOps transformation, we will delve into the different areas required to help you build a business case to ensure you get your ROI.   </p>

    <h2>When</h2>
    Saturday, 8th October
