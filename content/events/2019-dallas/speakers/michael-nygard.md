### <strong>KEYNOTE SPEAKER</strong>

Michael Nygard strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte. Michael has written and co-authored several books, including "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know" and the best seller "Release It!", a book about building software that survives the real world  

Michael has spent the better part of 20 years learning what it means to be a professional programmer who cares about art, quality, and craft. During that time, he has delivered running systems to the U. S. Government, the military, banking, finance, agriculture, and retail industries.  Michael has often lived with the systems he has built and this experience with the real world of operations changed his views about software architecture/ development forever.
