##### TALK ABSTRACT

DevOps requires a drastic shift from a traditional long-running project mindset. Best intentions can easily be thwarted simply because the new ways seem to go against the old way of thinking that teams and their managers hold so dearly.
<br><br>
The Chicken or the Egg? With so many changes in culture, mindset, and process involved in DevOps transformation, it can be difficult to see how outcomes will change without some hands-on context. But without changing the culture, mindset and process, there cannot be hands-on context.
<br><br>
In this talk, I’m going to temporarily set aside metrics and industry reports. I’ll use basic math to address some of the common arguments and anti-patterns I’ve seen.
<br><br>
For example, here’s a word problem: Mary, Joe, Tom, Sue, Harry and Ani are developers on a team. They have 6 features that all the require same level of effort. They are to have these features completed in 90 days. Provided everything goes exactly as planned, if they each work on a single feature then all 6 features will be done in exactly 90 days. If all 6 developers work together to complete the highest priority feature first, then work on the next highest priority, and so on, until all 6 features are complete, when will the highest priority feature be completed?
<br><br>
Answer: 15 days
<br><br>
We learn from this, that by working as a team, rather than a group of individuals, the most important feature can be delivered to our customers 84% faster. Join me for my talk, and we’ll take a fun dive from a new angle into the many points and counter-points to be found in this example and explore other “simple math” you can use to encourage DevOps culture and mindset at all levels in your organization.
