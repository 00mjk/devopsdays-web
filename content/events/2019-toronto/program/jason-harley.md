Title = "Introduction to Provisioning Cloud Infrastructure With Terraform"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["jason-harley"]

Terraform is a declarative and powerful provisioning tool that has seen an explosion in use and supported technology since its initial release in July, 2014.

This technical presentation will walk through the basics of Terraform and interactively codify, create, and configure a small set of AWS resources. Intended audience is for those new to Terraform or Infrastructure as Code, but all are welcome (obviously!).
