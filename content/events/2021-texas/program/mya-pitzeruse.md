GitOps has shown some significant improvements to the way software can be deployed and managed. For many, it’s simplified the deployment of tools and third-party services. It provides transparency around different workloads and their configuration. Still, there are many pain points associated with the practice.

In this talk, we’ll walk through getting started deploying and managing applications with GitOps. Using a few third-party applications, I’ll show how to set up a GitOps repository, strategies for leveraging CI to test new versions of applications, and even how to stay up to date. Finally, we’ll close with some considerations on scaling your GitOps practice.
