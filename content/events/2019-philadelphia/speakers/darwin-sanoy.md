Darwin Sanoy is a Senior Cloud Architect at Infor where he builds shared tooling for automating platform provisioning and continuous delivery. He has pivoted his career from Traditional Enterprise IT to Agile, DevOps and Cloud.

Darwin has been loving doing Windows automation for over 20 years - which means having the scars of Windows CLI automation before the Click-Next era of Windows management.

Darwin is a PluralSight course author, open source Chocolatey packager, CIS AWS Benchmark contributor (multi platform PowerShell code) and was awarded the “PowerShell Open Source Projects Top Contributor for 2017” designation for building a universal installer for the Windows port of OpenSSH. Darwin also built the Universal PowerShell Core bash installer (Install-PowerShell.sh) for installing PowerShell Core and Visual Studio Code on any supported Linux distro and OSX.

When Darwin isn’t on the trail trying to break his mountain bike, he is in his garage tuning it.
