Armando has 8 years of experience in software development. His passion for DevOps started 4 years ago when he discovered Docker. He joined Thoughtworks 2 years ago, where he has been able to bring, along with his teammates, the DevOps mindset to so many clients. Recently he's been working with Terraform and AWS, and he has learned about the challenges of implementing infrastructure as code at companies that do not have a DevOps culture established.
