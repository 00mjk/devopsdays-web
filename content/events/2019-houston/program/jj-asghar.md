Hes a member of the Church of Emacs, though jumps into Vim on remote machines. He usually chooses Ubuntu over CentOS, but secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere. Hes always trying to become a better Ruby developer, but flirts with Go, Rust, and only when he has to, Node. A father and husband, if hes not trying to automate his job away hes always to convince his daughters to be button makers not button pushers.You see this cloud-native thing creep into some conversations. You are starting to see your boss reading this Kubernetes book. Youve googled around about both, but all the terms and technology is hard to grasp. Luckily this talk Ill walk through in 20 slides everything you need to know about Kubernetes to be dangerous. From there you can take it and focus on what you need to know and start discovering it for yourself.
