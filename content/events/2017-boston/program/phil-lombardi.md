Microservices is an increasingly popular approach to building cloud-native applications. Dozens of new technologies that streamline adopting microservices development such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Envoy have been released over the past few years. But how do you actually use these technologies together to develop, deploy, and run microservices?

In this workshop, we’ll start with an introduction to Docker and Kubernetes concepts. From there, we’ll teach a series of hands-on exercises that cover the nuances of deploying containerized applications on Kubernetes, including creating a Kubernetes manifest, debugging and logging, and more. We’ll tie what we just did by hand with an exercise to build an automated continuous deployment pipeline. Finally, we’ll do a brief tour of some of the advanced concepts related to microservices, including service mesh, canary deployments, resilience, and security.
