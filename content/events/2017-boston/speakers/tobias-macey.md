I am an engineer with experience in many disciplines. I have worked at various times as a systems administrator, a software engineer, a systems engineer, an Android developer and a data engineer. In the course of filling these various roles I have gained experience in Python, Django, Flask, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, jQuery, Bash, SaltStack, Linux administration and a whole array of other technologies too numerous to mention. If Iâ€™m not working hard to make a client happy then I am ikely to be found researching a new technology to add to my arsenal. I maintain a blog at renaissancedev.com and host Podcast.init and the Data Engineering Podcast.
