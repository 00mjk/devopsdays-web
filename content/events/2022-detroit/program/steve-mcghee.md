Introducing a new learning tool we call the “r9y map” (reliability map) modeled after the Tech Tree from the Civ video game series. Helping teams identify what capabilities they can already do, find what they hope to achieve, and to plot a course on how to get there.

See a preview at r9y.dev — this is a call for participation and the introduction of a community aiming to make the whole internet more reliable. This is a vendor or technology agnostic approach.
