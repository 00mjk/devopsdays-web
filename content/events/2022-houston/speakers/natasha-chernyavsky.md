Natasha is a Sr. Backend and Big Data Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience. She loves solving complex problems and even more so when the solutions are beautiful. Natasha finds almost everything interesting and worth learning (even when itâ€™s below binging Netflix on her priorities list) and is especially fascinated by data and everything that handling it entails whether it's modeling, processing, storing, and querying up to its performance tuning.
