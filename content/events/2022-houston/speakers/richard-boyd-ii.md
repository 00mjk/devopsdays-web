I'm the Operational Excellence Pillar Lead for the Well-Architected Framework. I evolve the best practices in my part of the framework and work with customers to improve their architectural health. Outside of work I'm an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin, DevOpsDays Texas, and ServerlessDays Austin, as well as the Cloud Austin and Austin AWS Users Meetup. I'm a US Army Veteran and love to give back to the DevOps community in any way that I can.
