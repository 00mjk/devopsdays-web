## Keynote Speakers

### Karen Lawton

Karen Lawton, CEO and Founder of SJ Technologies, has worked in information technology for over 18 years. She started her career by co-founding an Oracle-centric software company in 1997, during the dot com era. Karen was quick to learn critical aspects of running a  business and rose to every challenge she faced, like raising the $12 million needed to grow the business through three rounds of venture capital.
Early in her career, Karen was fortunate to be mentored by experienced industry executives whose guidance helped her successfully obtain strategic accounts with organizations like GE, Fidelity Investments and the LA County Sheriffs’ Department. Since then, her focus has been on business development and account management in the areas of software solutions, platform and system architecture, and business systems.
