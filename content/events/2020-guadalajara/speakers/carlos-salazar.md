Graduated as a Software Engineer from UNAM, for the last 7 years I have been working as a Software Engineer mostly with Java and Spring for big corporates such as Scotiabank or HPE. Currently as a Sr. Software Engineer & Practice lead at Kenzan, which is a client service startup focused on CloudNative Microservices.
