Keeping up with the rate of change in the technology landscape is hard and even though there are all-day conferences, boot-camps and workshops you can attend, attending local Meetups are an easier accessible and more cost-effective way to learn and interact with people who are trying to solve the same problems as you are, or if you want to socialize with people with similar interests. 

Going to these events however can be a daunting ordeal, for example when you’ve just moved to the city, don’t have anyone to go with or feel like you don’t belong at a certain group because you haven’t used a certain technology yet. 

Dominique and Margo founded Meetup Mates to do what we can to give back to the community, because we believe everyone should be able to enjoy these events as much as we do. With over 80 sign-ups in the first month, the goal is to make attending Meetups a fun and more inclusive experience for everyone. This ignite will provide you a platform to confidently go to your first Meetup or be able to (find your) mentor tomorrow!
