Tim Gross is an operations engineer, technical manager, software developer, and general solver-of-problems-with-duct-tape. He's done everything from designing PKI infrastructure for IoT to writing open source projects for building self-assembling distributed systems. Tim once ran ops at DramaFever, where he and his scrappy team ran Docker in production to serve a few million fans their daily dose of dramas, documentaries, and gross-out horror movies. In another life, Tim was an architect (buildings, not software). He took the leap into technology after he discovered he could automate away almost everything boring in his life.
