This talk will provide a brief introduction/recap of what containers are; on Linux and Windows. Next an overview and definition of OCI runtime, a runtime daemon and an orchestration tool will clear up the different layers in the container cake. The conclusion will start as a discussion of the current ecosystems and where they overlap, followed by an outlook of where containers are moving.
