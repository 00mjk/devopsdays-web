Come up with a plan TOGETHER with Dmitry. Try to transition Dmitry into a coaching role Discuss guidelines for using Brett . You want to keep him in the loop but you don’t get people getting lazy and always going to him. Talk to the team: use Dmitry as a second opinion, not the first one. Use other team members as a sounding board first. Never come empty handed. Strive to start the conversation with a suggestion. pairing for complex problems. Force the Brett to disconnect: prove to the team that they can live without him You shouldn’t alienate Dmitry, but should help him grow like any other team member. And yes, this ends with a separation (re Ben Rockwood https://youtu.be/SjuF1IW7Ykk?t=1310), but it shouldn’t be traumatic to either side.</p>
