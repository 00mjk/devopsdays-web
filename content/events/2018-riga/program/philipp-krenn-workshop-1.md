<p>We dive into:

<ul>
<li>System metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.</li>
<li>Application logs: Collect structured logs in a central location.</li>
<li>Uptime monitoring: Ping services and actively monitor their availability and response time.</li>
<li>Application metrics: Get the information from about application’s metrics and health via REST or JMX.</li>
<li>Request tracing: Use Sleuth to trace requests through a distributed system and Zipkin to show how long each call takes.</li>
<li>And we will do all of that live, since it is so easy and much more interactive that way.</li>
</ul>
