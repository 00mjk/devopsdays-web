Submissions for DevOpsDays Hartford have closed. But You have not missed your chance to share your ideas! We're short this year on Ignite-format talks and want to hear from you! A second, special proposal form is open and will remain open until we have enough submissions.

**Submit your talks and find out more about Ignites on [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/Q36hLWsfR6ofXPji1)**


Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _local presenters_: people relatively local to the Greater Hartford area. While not a requirement, we love to hear what our local community is doing most.
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.

If you think you have an idea for an Ignite, please use [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/Q36hLWsfR6ofXPji1) to propose your topic to the selection committee.
