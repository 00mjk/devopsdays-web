I have over 25 years of experience in the Software Quality Assurance and Testing field. I have been involved in the implementation of test automation and performance testing solutions in hundreds of environments across a wide array of industries. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been involved with bringing quality practices (with a focus on automation) to DevOps teams.

I regularly speak at industry conferences including StarEast, STPCon, and QUEST.
