ELK sucks. Well, not really. It’s awesome. It’s just that on a large scale, things can quickly go from bad to worse. Maintaining a production-grade ELK Stack/Elastic Stack is more than just configuring Logstash, and involves day-to-day tasks and challenges that we need to take care of.

The ELK Stack is the world’s most popular log analysis platform, used by hundreds of thousands of companies. Installing the stack is easy and setting up an initial pipeline also relatively simple. But as our data grows, things start to get more complicated. Configuring multiple pipelines, adding security, upgrading to new versions, archiving log data, scaling up Elasticsearch – these are just some of the topics that we need to take into consideration. This ignite talk will focus, mostly in a humorist fashion, on the main challenges we need to deal with when deploying a production-grade ELK stack. ELK is a fantastic tool to use, but needs some taming.
