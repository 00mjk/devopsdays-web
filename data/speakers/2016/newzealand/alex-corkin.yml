bio: "Hi I'm Alex
I spent a portion of time in the Army, then I left to do CompSci at Auckland University.

I did an internship at Spark Ventures and was on-hired. I spent a year there and now work for Healthlink.

My background is in web applications with node and java, more and more I find myself drawn to a mixture of applications and infrastructure.

I think Pilsner is superior to IPA and that Guinness is best served at room temperature. If I'm drinking a loaf of bread, that bread better be warm."
